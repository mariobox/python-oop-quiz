# Quiz Console App 

This is a quiz implemented with object-oriented-programming in Python.

## Specs

The quiz must accomodate any number of questions, passed to the class via a list.

The questions and their different possible answers need to be printed to the console, which needs to be cleaned after the user submits their answer to each question, so that only one question and its answers are visible to the user at any given time.

The app needs to keep track of the correct answers vs. the total number of questions, and display this tally after each question answered.

The app needs to display the words "Quiz Over!" and the final score once all the questions have been answered.

The quiz needs to implement validation of the answers (only a, b, c and d allowed, and no blank input).

Since there is only one quiz, we don't need to create class instances, so no self argument will be needed. 

All methods created inside the Quiz class will be class methods.
